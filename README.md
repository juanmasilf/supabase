This repository is used for the Serverless Architecture Course at ORT University.

## Exercises

We use 2 libraries in order to do the exercises of the lessons, [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
We divide the course in two, the second half using [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

Exercises are divided in folders depending on the library and language used.

### flutter/authentication

Lesson that consisted on explaining Supabase and the Supabase Authentication service.
